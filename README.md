# Linear-Regression

This repository contains a simple implementation of Linear Regression Algorithm.

# Data

- `/data_set_1/` contain 2 types of data, <br /><br />
  - `ex1data1.txt` is single variable linear regression data about Population of a city Vs Profit of food truck business <br />
  - `ex1data2.txt` is multi-variable linear regression data <br /> <br />
- `/data_set_2/` conatins single variable linear regression data split into `train.csv` and `test.csv`

# Prepairing and Running Linear Regression

- `data_set_1/ex1data1.txt` contains 97 set of examples which are split into 90 for training and 7 for testing
  - Execute `python linear_regression_data_1.py`
- `/data_set_2/` contains separete training (699 examples) and testing (300 examples) data examples
  - Execute `python linear_regression_data_2.py`
